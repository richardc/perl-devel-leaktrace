	Fix the INIT/BEGIN thing correctly by adding resetting as an
	independant action

	Small speedup.  At every boundary check that PL_sv_count hasn't 
	changed.  There's potential for this to fuck up in the case where you
	free and create an SV in the same statement.  Never mind the 
	correctness, feel the speed.
